the same survey to all rangers who have volunteered in the last 5 years.
This repo contains code of intra and inter year analysis as well as some
funny processing stuff for pulling responses into google sheets for qualitative analysis.

## Hey! Be careful.
Source data and results are considered very sensitive. So, if you are working
on this repo, please be extra careful to not check in any data or results. If
you run the Jupyter Notebook, please clear the output before committing back
to the repo. I'll add some post commit hooks ot make sure this happens, but,
consider yourself warned.
